            I'm an entrepreneur who initially came to Bozeman in 2018 for rock
            climbing and stayed for the building. I specialize in home remodels
            and in my free time I like to get out in nature and practice
            jiujitsu.

              &quot;Elias was prompt, hard-working, and has a positive attitude.
              He made sure the job was done right. Good attention to detail. I'd
              definitely hire him again.&quot; <br />

              &quot;Elias Uribe has worked on several projects for me over the
              last three years on property in Cottonwood Canyon south of
              Bozeman. Elias is profoundly thoughtful in his work. I have never
              hired or worked with a professional who is equally dedicated,
              skilled and tireless. Elias will bring insight and problem-solving
              skills to your project. You will find that he is personable with
              clients and colleagues alike. I canâ€™t recommend Elias highly
              enough and I look forward to hiring him on my upcoming
              architectural projects. There is no one I would rather have on my
              team.&quot;

              &quot;Elias' work was quality, on time, on budget, and with a
              great attitude. I will work with Elias again!&quot;
